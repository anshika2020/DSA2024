What is sliding window pattern?
Ans:
1. The main idea behind the sliding window is reduce two for loops to one single for loop.
2. The sliding window is used to perform a required operation on specific window size of given array or linkedlist for ex. finding the longest subarray
3. The window size can remains constant, shrink or grow.

How to identify the pattern in problems?
1. The problem input is linear data structure
2. You’re asked to find the longest/shortest substring, subarray, or a desired value

Common examples:
* Maximum sum subarray of size ‘K’ (easy)
* Longest substring with ‘K’ distinct characters (medium)
* String anagrams (hard)


TODO list:
1. Maximum Sum Subarray of Size K (easy)
2.Smallest Subarray With a Greater Sum (easy)
3.Longest Substring with maximum K Distinct Characters (medium)
4.Fruits into Baskets (medium)
5.Longest Substring with Distinct Characters (hard)
6.Longest Substring with Same Letters after Replacement (hard)
7. Longest Subarray with Ones after Replacement (hard)
